# Is it ready for Windows ARM64?

Basically ["Is Apple Silicon ready?"](https://isapplesiliconready.com/) but for Windows ARM64

## Planning

* It just need to be a static HTML for now
    * Since there probably won't be too many apps for a while, just manually update table in HTML would be enough
* User can just use browser search
* Information needed
    * Name
    * Link to app
    * Last check date
    * Last check version
    * 32-bit, 64bit, or native
    * Does it work or not
